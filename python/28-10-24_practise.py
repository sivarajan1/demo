    oops: object oriented programing system in python

    key concepts: classes,objects,inhertence,polymorphism,encapsulation,abstraction
    class: a class is blue print or template for creating objects
    object: an object is an instance of a class,representing real world entity.
    inhertance: a child class inherits properties and methods from a parent class
    polymorphism: ability of an object to take multiple forms,
    * method overriding or method overloading
    encapsulation: hiding internal implemention details,
    * accessing data through methods
    abstraction: showing essential features,
    hiding non-essential features.

    uses cases of oops: simulation games,banking systems,e-commerce platforms,social media platforms,
    graphics and game engines,network management system,database management system,artifical intelligence
    & machine learning,web browsers,operating systems

    real time appliction platform: e-commerce platform,hospital management,student information system
